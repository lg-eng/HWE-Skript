# Description  

This is the repository for the lecture notes on hardware design. In German *Hardwareentwicklung - HWE*. In time it will cover most of the teaching content for the subject HWE, as I teach it at the the school for technical informatics and electronic design in Innsbruck, *HTL Anichstra√üe Innsbruck*.  
At the moment, the project is just beginning. 
The content is created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

# Issues and Contribution
I put forth my best effort to create accurate and well-explained content. Nonetheless, mistakes can happen, and there is always room for improvement. Therefore, I would greatly appreciate it if you could point out any errors or share your ideas. GitHub was chosen for multiple reasons, one of them being the opportunity for collaboration. If you're interested in getting actively involved, please send me a message.
